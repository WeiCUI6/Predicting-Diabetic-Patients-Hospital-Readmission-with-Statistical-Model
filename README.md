# Predicting-Diabetic-Patients-Hospital-Readmission-with-Statistical-Model

## Introduction

* Diabetes is a widely distributed chronic disease that is characterised by blood glucose levels abnormalities due to insulin-related problems. The prevalence of diabetes is growing most rapidly in low- and middle-income countries [1].

* Readmission to hospital is defined by the period a patient is taking before returning to the hospital. Readmission is considered a indicator of hospital success in terms of efficiency and a way of reducing healthcare costs. Hospitals are financially penalised if the permitted 30-day readmissions rate is exceeded. The United States Medicare Payment Advisory Commission evaluated that preventing 10% of readmissions will save more than $1 billion for Medicare in the US [2].

* Therefore, in order to not only improve the quality of healthcare but also reduce the medical expenses on readmission, itâ€™s important for us to create interventions to provide additional assistance to diabetic patients with increased risk of readmission. Thus, our goal of the study focuses on coming up with a statistical model to predict if a patient with diabetes will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.
